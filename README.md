# Predicting Future Consumer Spending and Credit Line Increases

## Overview
In today's financial landscape, accurately forecasting customer spending and managing credit exposure is key to both customer satisfaction and organizational growth. This project develops a predictive framework to forecast Q4 2025 spending, identify accounts eligible for credit line increases (CLI), and recommend adjustments while mitigating financial risk.

## Objectives
- Analyze: historical account and non-monetary data to uncover spending behavior.
- Predict: Q4 2025 spending using the most recent 8 months of data.
- Classify: accounts that may benefit from a credit line increase based on spending forecasts.
- Recommend: optimal CLI amounts while accounting for overextension, fraud risk, and potential defaults.
